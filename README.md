Hello World!

This is an assembler project I'm working on for the upcoming Telum0 homebrew CPU. 

Please note that the assembler does not accept regular assembly, but rather my own simplified version of assembly based on what I know as of now.

Just note that if you are to read my code, it is just meant for me and that I will not provide any support for other systems or for any pet architecture you want. I may make another compiler which is semi-production worthy, but that is for another day.

The code is written in python3, but may work in python 2.7 (untested).

In order to run the assembler, open a terminal and type:

$ python3 assembler.py {file to be assembled} {output file name}
